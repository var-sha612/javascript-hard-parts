async model vs promises
In async model there is no consistency(state maintanence) between browser and JS global memory
everything happens in the browser

we need some sort of tracking back in JS global memory - promise helps us with this
promise -> when you trigger something in the background, have some sort of 

promise -> two pronged facade function
one prong in browser and other in JS memory

fetch - most powerful JS

call stack
event loop

microtask queue
callback queue

How does microtask queue work? -> 

facade functions with promise -> microtask queue
other facade fns -> callback queue


then function should be renamed to STORE FUNCTION TO RUN LATER
