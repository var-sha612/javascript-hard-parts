Single Threaded Execution

Why we need Async JS?
Twitter tweets response (we cant wait until we get back all the tweets, we have to display the website in the meantime)
Slack Emojis

Resources:
microtask queue:

JS provides FACADE FUNCTIONS to interact with the browser features

CALLBACK QUEUE VS CALL STACK
callback queueu wouldnt dequeue into call stack even if we have 
million console logs

ALL REGULAR CODE RUNS
callback queue checks this:
is the callback queue empty
is the global empty

very fast checking of this type is call EVENT LOOP

CALLBACK HELL

response data is only accessible in the callback function - callback hell
benefit - super explicit
